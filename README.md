# Senior Full-Stack Engineer

I’m an enthusiastic Senior Full-Stack Engineer with 7+ years of experience in technologies such as Dart, Flutter and Google Cloud.

I've successfully delivered many web, iOS, Android and desktop applications, and I've written a ton of open source packages and documentation.

I specialise in modular, scalable and maintainable architecture design, and take pride in my work.

I’m actively looking for opportunities and I'm eager to build connections!
